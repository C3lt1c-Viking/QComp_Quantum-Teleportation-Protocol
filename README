# Quantum Computer Programming Teleportal Algorithm #

The ability to transfer (aka copy/paste) files from one location on our classic computers is easy. In fact, this is a common practice we do every single day.
However, this simple task on a Quantum Computer proves to be much more difficult as when you copy data from one Qubit, you are indeed destroying it.

We have a solution in which we will design a basic algorithm in order to easily transfer data from Qubit 0 to Qubit 2.

To move a bit from 0 to 1, utilize an X-Gate 

This can be performed with;
circuit.x(0)

This sets a default value on the Q0 string with X-Gate.

Now we are going to start our intanglement between Q1 & Q2
Apply a Hadarmard Gate as well as an X-Gate
circuit.h(1)
circuit.cx(1,2)

Now we are going to setup a Controlled Gate and a secondary Hadarmard Gate;
circuit.cx(0,1)
circuit.h(0)

Now we will create our measurments;
circuit.barrier() ~ This allows us to visually see differences in previous codes
circuit.measure([0,1], [0,1])

Create a secondary barrier to seperate code blocks
circuit.barrier()

Now we are going to apply our Controled Gate to switch between Q1 & Q2 Strings
circuit.cx(1,2)

And finally, we will be setting up a CPhase Gate to assist on linking our Qubits together
circuit.cz(0,2)

And we can draw out our pattern;
circuit.draw(output='mpl')

Out come looks like this;

Q0: |0> ---X---|------*-H-|--/------|-----*--
Q1: |0> -------|--H-*-+---|--|---/--|--*--|--
Q2: |0> -------|----+-----|--|---|--|--+--*--

We took "X" on Q0 and moved it to Q2!
This representation of Teleportation from one Qubit to Another is not an easy task. But it is indeed exciting to discover how this operation...operates!
